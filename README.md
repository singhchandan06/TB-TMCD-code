# TB-TMCD-code
 It is Tight Binding Hamiltonian code for low energy bands
 hopping and onsite energies are calculated using VASP + Wannier90 code
 This code is written by Chandan K. Singh and Surajit Sarkar
 We have written this code based on the tight binding Hamilonian from the followinga paper : Phys. Rev. B 88 085433 (2013)
